		<h2>Artificial Satellite</h2>
		<p>Artificial satellite is the name of any body made by Man and placed in orbit around the Earth or any other celestial body. To date, there have been thousands of launches of these bodies to space, but most are already disabled. When failures occur in the launch or in the satellite itself, parts of them may be orbiting the planet indefinitely, forming space junk. Technically, these objects are also satellites, although the term itself is used to refer to the apparatus that was put into orbit to perform a specific function.</p>
		<p>Communication</p>
		<p>They distribute the signals of telephony, Internet and TV in various orbits, especially in the geostationary ones. More than half of the satellites that orbit Earth are communication. Most use the geostationary orbit to stand on a single point on Earth - so antennas like satellite dishes do not have to search the satellite in space to receive the signals.</p>
		<p>OBSERVATION OF THE EARTH</p>
		<p>In this category are the satellites of Multiples utilities. It all depends on the equipment attached to them. CBERS has high-resolution cameras to photograph the Amazon. They are from observation satellites that leave the images to mount Google Earth.</p>
		<p>MILITARY</p>
		<p>Military satellites can photograph territories with precision of a few centimeters. And because they have infrared sensing, they can even spot targets in the dark or camouflaged by detecting them by the emission of heat. GPS is also at the service of the military, helping missiles to reach targets with greater accuracy.</p>
		<p>SPACE RESEARCH</p>
		<p>Almost all the images we have of space come from telescopes coupled to satellites. The most famous of them, Hubble, has been in orbit since 1990 and already has its developing successor: James Webb. With mirrors seven times larger than Hubble's, it will be a distance of 1.5 million km from Earth</p>
		<p>NAVIGATION</p>
		<p>GPS is a constellation of 24 satellites that detect the position of any receiver on Earth - such as GPS-enabled cellphones. It is controlled by the US Department of Defense, but can be used for free by anyone who has a receiver. Russia and the European Union also have their navigation systems, Glonass and Galileo.</p>
		<p>GEOSTATIONARY</p>
		<p>Orbit supercongested by communication satellites, moving on the equator following the rotation of the planet and following fixed on a point. The satellite signals about 35,000 km from Earth arrive with a delay of Â¼ of a second.</p>
		<p>POLAR</p>
		<p>As the name says, these satellites pass over the poles of the planet, wandering in a north-south direction. As the Earth rotates, they cross the Equator in different lengths, and can map the entire planet. It is a very used orbit in meteorological satellites</p>
		<p>LOW</p>
		<p>Here the satellites are between 600 and 700 km from the Earth and are very fast: they travel at 27 400 km / h, going around the planet every 90 minutes. With the exception of a few missions - such as going to the Moon - all manned space travel was made in this orbit</p>
		<p>AVERAGE</p>
		<p>Among the satellites that occupy this orbit, 96% are navigation, such as those of the GPS system. The average orbit ranges from 1 000 to 35 700 km from Earth. In the distance used by the GPS - 20 thousand km -, the satellites take about 11 hours to go around the planet</p>
		<p>HIGH</p>
		<p>In high orbits, the satellites are over 35 700 km away. They follow an elliptical trajectory, spinning faster near Earth and slower when long. Thus, they can stay long periods on a part of the planet
