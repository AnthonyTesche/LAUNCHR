		<h2>Space Rocket</h2>
		<p>A space rocket is a machine that moves by expelling behind itself a gas flow. By keeping the amount of movement (mass multiplied by speed),the rocket moves in the directionspeed such that, multiplied by the mass of the rocket, the value of the momentum is equal to that of the exhaust gases. By extension, the generally spatial vehicle having a motor (s) of This type of propulsion is called rocket, rocket or missile. Normally, Its purpose is to send objects (especially artificial satellites and space probes) and / or spaceships and men to space (see atmosphere). A rocket consists of a structure, a propulsion reaction and a payload. The structure serves to house the tanks of fuel and oxidant and payload.
There are several ways of forcing exhaust gases out of the rocket with enough energy to be able to propel the rocket forward (i.e., various types of rocket engine). The most common type, which includes all the space rockets that currently exist and have flown to this day,are the so-called chemical rockets, which work by releasing the energy chemistry contained in your fuel through the combustion process. These rockets also need to carry an oxidizer to react with the fuel. This mixture of superheated gases is, then, expanded in a divergent nozzle, the Tubeira de Laval, also known such as Bell Tube, in order to direct the expanding gas backwards, and so you can propel the rocket forward.

There are, however, other types of engine, for example engines nuclear, which overheat a gas to high temperatures, using heat generated by nuclear reactions, in particular through nuclear fission process, where nuclear fuel is bombarded with neutrons, leading to the fission of nuclei of atoms. This gas is then expanded in the nozzle just like in chemical rockets. These kind of rocket was developed and tested in the United States during the 1960s, but never came to be used. The gases expelled by this type of rocket may be radioactive, which discourages its use within the atmosphere terrestrial, but can be used outside of it. This type of rocket has the advantage of allowing efficiencies far superior to those of chemical rockets since they allow the exhaust gas to be speeds much higher. Today it is Russia that stands out in the development of thermal nuclear engines, recovering the old Soviet space program.
		You know that during the launch of a space shuttle, the propellers (solid rocket boosters - SBRs) are released after giving the necessary initial impulse. But where will they stop? Finally,The first time, NASA showed a video in good definition rescuing rockets.Once the thrusters are collected by the two teams (Liberty Star and Freedom Star) and a team of divers, they are sent to Utah to be reused and stored. This particular video happened shortly after Discovery's latest launch on February 24.

	The Soyuz rocket and its Soyuz MS-10 space capsule have taken off from the Cosmodrome of Baikonur, in Kazakhstan, around 05:47 AM NASA astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin on board. they should join the crew of three people on Expedition 57 already board of the International Space Station. But something went wrong minutes after launch, sending the Soyuz capsule for a ballistic re-entry."Confirming once again that the launch of today's MS10 S10 has entered into ballistic re-entry mode shortly after its launch, "he said. Dean during the live commentary on television. "This means that the crew will not be going to the International Space Station today. In instead, they will make a forced landing back to Earth. "
The three astronauts aboard the space station were of the failed launch and the day's schedule is being reformulated, already that they will no longer be able to receive the pair that is coming. The control of mission told astronauts aboard the space station that during the "boys" experienced forces of about 6.7 G in a transmission that NASA later did.
The pair landed about 20 kilometers east of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. "Search and rescue teams are always pre-equipped in case something like that, "Dean added. Helicopters have already been dispatched to search for the Soyuz space capsule. returning to Earth in a ballistic descent mode. Teams are working for additional information from our Russian partners.
NASA did not provide many details about the fault, but confirmed in a tweet that there was a problem with rocket separation. Dean later confirmed the anomaly during the live commentary. During transmission to the alive, the mission control narration suggested that the rocket could not separate from the Soyuz capsule.
If the launch had been successful, Ovchinin and Hague would have station today. Soyuz was scheduled to make a flight trajectory of
six hours and would have orbited Earth four times before reaching the International Space Station. space shuttle Columbia, 2003 The Columbia space shuttle that had a damaged wing during launch, exploded in the skies of Texas during his reentry on Earth, killing seven astronauts and spreading debris over Texas and Louisiana. The investigators determined that the left wing was damaged by foam insulation of the fuel tank during launch,allowing flaming gases to penetrate the fuselage of the space shuttle.

Space Shuttle Challenger, 1986
The Challenger space shuttle exploded over Cape Canaveral, Florida only a few seconds after the release. Seven crew members, including civilian teacher Christa McAuliffe died, and the space program man was never the same after that. The disaster caused NASA to rethink pilots' survival modules, and ways to ejection were also thought of. The cause of the disaster was problems in two the fuel tank o-rings, which are rings responsible for making the sealing between two surfaces.

Space missions that failed: Soyuz 1, 1967
It was not just the United States that suffered tragedies during the space race. Soviet commander Vladimir Komarov was killed when his spacecraft during his return to Earth after a mission plagued by mechanical problems. The Soviet space program would still years, with several other successes, and to this day Russia continues to a successful space program. Missions that failed: Soyuz 11, 1971 Soyuz 11 was the first successful visit to the first space station world, Salyut. The mission ended in tragedy when the crew was depressurised during the preparations for re-entry, killing the three crew members on board: Vladislav Volkov, Georgi Dobrovolski and Viktor Patsayev.

Space missions that went wrong: Mars Polar Lander, 1999
NASA lost a Mars satellite that was worth $ 125 million. It's the worse was the reason for the error: parts were built by different companies and space agencies. Only one of them used the metric system of measurements andanother, the imperial system (US standard). Sad end to a promising mission.

Brazilian Space Program: Alc√¢ntara, 2003
The prototype of the VLS-1 rocket was being tested for release, but exploded 3 days before its launch, killing 21 people. The cause of explosion was the premature ignition of one of the engines, caused by a small part that started the engine. Failure of working and working conditions were also detected in the researchers' report. As the rocket was still covered by the protective structure, the people who was in the structure died. The blow suffered by the Space Program Brazilian with the loss of trained personnel and poor publicity was high, but it has been resuming its successes in order to be able to launch independent rockets and even serving the missions given by clients countries.</p>
